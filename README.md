# beermat-repo

All written in Kotlin.

Small sample app to demonstrate the taking of screenshots of your app using Espresso.
See the screenshots package in the app module under src/androidTest/java/de/hajo/beermat

Execute it with the screenshotRunner.sh in the project root dir.
E.g. in terminal with this command:
./screenshotRunner.sh

Don't be surprised, three emulators (nexus 5,7 and 9) will be started sequentially :-)
Find the final report with all the screenshots in the app module under build/espresso-screenshots
