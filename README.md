# beermat-repo

Small sample app to demonstrate the taking of screenshots of your app using Espresso.
See the screenshots package under src/androidTest/java/de.hajo.beermat

All written in Kotlin.

Execute it with the screenshotRunner.sh in the project root dir.
E.g. in terminal with this command:
./screenshotRunner.sh

Don't be surprised, three emulators (nexus5,7,9) will be started :-)
